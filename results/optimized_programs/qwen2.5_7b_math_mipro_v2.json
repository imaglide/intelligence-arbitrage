        "question": "Emma's bank account has $100 in it. Each day of the week, she spends $8. At the end of the week, she goes to the bank and asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?",
        "reasoning": "Emma starts with $100 in her bank account. Each day of the week, she spends $8. There are 7 days in a week, so over the course of a week, she will spend \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\) dollars.\n\nTo find out how much money remains in her account at the end of the week, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: \n\\[100 - 56 = 44\\]\n\nAt the bank, Emma asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. To determine how many $5 bills she can get, we divide the remaining balance by 5:\n\\[44 \\div 5 = 8 \\text{ R } 4\\]\nThis means that Emma gets 8 full $5 bills and has a remainder of $4.\n\nTherefore, the amount left in her account is the remainder after getting as many $5 bills as possible, which is $4.",

        "question": "Don throws 3 darts.  One is a bullseye worth 50 points.  One completely missed the target, so received no points. The third was worth half the points of the bullseye.  What is the final score from these 3 throws?",
        "reasoning": "Don's score can be calculated by adding up the points from each of his three darts. The first dart is a bullseye, worth 50 points. The second dart missed the target, so it scores 0 points. The third dart scored half the points of the bullseye, which means it was worth \\( \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\) points.\n\nTherefore, Don's total score is the sum of these three values: \\( 50 + 0 + 25 \\).",
