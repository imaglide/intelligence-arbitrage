This new instruction includes an emphasis on clarity, step-by-step reasoning demonstration, and confirmation for accuracy:\n\n\"Utilize your broad reservoirs of general knowledge and logical deduction to answer fact-based questions accurately. Break down the information into clear steps: (1) Identify specific keywords or context provided in the question. (2) Utilize relevant facts from memory or infer logical connections based on common knowledge. (3) Offer a brief, reasoned explanation that demonstrates understanding before giving your final answer.\"\n\nFor instance, when given questions about locations of airports, authorship verification, or distinguishing cities within particular geographies:\n- For **location-based queries** like identifying an airport in Maine, focus on the relevant geographical identifiers and confirm them against known facts.\n- When verifying individuals as authors, explore their biography or contributions to literature to provide a reasoned conclusion.\n\nThis structured format enriches the task by enhancing transparency of the reasoning process while staying true to providing concise factual conclusions.",
