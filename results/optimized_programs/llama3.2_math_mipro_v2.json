        "question": "Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?",
        "reasoning": "1. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 seashells.\n2. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found 2 x 24 = 48 seashells.\n3. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so she took 1\/3 x 48 = 16 seashells.",

        "question": "Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?",
        "reasoning": "Step 1: Olaf's initial collection is 150 cars.\nStep 2: The uncle gave Olaf x toy cars. Since Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, which is 1 more than the uncle, we can set up an equation: x + 1 = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 5.\nStep 3: Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so he gave 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars.\nStep 4: Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, which is 5 less than Mum. So, Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars.\nStep 5: Now we can add up all the toy cars Olaf received: 10 (from Grandpa) + 5 (from Uncle) + 6 (from Auntie) + 10 (from Dad) + 15 (from Mum) = 46\nStep 6: Finally, we add the initial collection to the total number of toy cars Olaf received: 150 + 46 = 196",

        "question": "Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?",
        "reasoning": "To find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to first calculate how much he hiked in the first two days. \nHe hiked 10 kilometers on the first day.\nOn the second day, he covered half of the full hike distance, which is 50 \/ 2 = 25 kilometers.\n\nSo, for the first two days, Ezekiel hiked a total of 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.\n\nSince the total hike distance is 50 kilometers, we subtract the distance covered in the first two days from the total to find out how much he had to hike on the third day:\n50 - 35 = 15",

Rocks make a splash that is 1\/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?",
