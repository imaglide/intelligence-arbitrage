Multiple art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, South State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.

He had no responsibility for the other three zones, controlled by Britain, France and the Soviet Union, except for the city of Berlin, which was managed by the Four-Power Authorities through the Allied Kommandatura as the governing body. Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials. He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067, but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization. In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment. His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis.",

        "context": "Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincar\u00e9 founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[\u203a] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.",

The following instructional prompt incorporates elements from the provided dataset description, program structure, and successful demonstration to guide responses effectively:\n\n---\n\n**Instruction for Prompting LM:**\n\n1. **Initial Step - Understanding Context**: When presented with the text, begin by carefully reading through the entire context. Pay close attention to the specific details that relate directly or indirectly to the question asked. This involves identifying relevant sentences or paragraphs within the context.\n\n2. **Question Analysis**: Analyze the question to understand what exact information is being requested. Determine if the question requires a direct fact, a comparison, an identification of relationships, or any other type of extraction from the context.\n\n3. **Reasoning Approach**:\n    - Engage in a logical analysis process, examining how different parts of the context can be pieced together to form a coherent answer.\n    - Look for specific keywords within both the question and context that are closely related to each other; this will guide you in finding where the answer lies.\n    - Make sure your reasoning is clear and structured. Outline step-by-step how you arrive at the answer based on the information provided.\n\n4. **Extraction and Answering**: Once the logical foundation for understanding has been established, extract the precise piece of information that addresses the question accurately. Ensure the solution is both concise and directly relevant to what was asked.\n   \n5. **Final Output**:\n   - Present your **reasoning**: Describe how you interpreted the context in relation to the question, explaining each step taken toward arriving at an answer.\n   - Provide the **answer**: Supply a clear, direct response extracted from the context, making it succinct and comprehensive.\n\nBy following these detailed steps within this instruction set, ensure the process remains systematic and logically oriented towards extracting correct answers for diverse subject areas covered in your dataset.\n\n---",
