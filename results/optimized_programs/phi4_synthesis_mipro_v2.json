        "document": "Money allocated to children's centres, which provide services to families, has fallen by 35% in five years, according to new calculations by Barnardo's.\nThe charity wants the government to ensure councils have the funding \"to prioritise these important services\".\nThe government said councils had a duty to meet the needs of local families.\nResearchers for the charity analysed the education spending of every local authority in England and figures from the Department for Education.\nOverall, they calculate that expenditure on children's centres declined from \u00a31.2bn in 2010-11 to an estimated \u00a3740m in 2014-15.\n\"The evidence is stark: children's centre funding has been leaking away year after year, leading to the closure or merging of hundreds of these lifeline services across England,\" the charity concludes.\nLocal authorities are having to make tough decisions as their budgets are reduced, says the charity.\nEngland currently has a network of about 2,800 children's centres, of which Barnardo's runs 190, providing a range of services.\nThese include general drop-in sessions and classes for children and their families as well as specialist help for more vulnerable families, for example counselling or learning support.\n\"Children's centres are a really good, low-key way of engaging with families and stepping in with support where it's needed,\" said a Barnardo's spokeswoman.\nThe charity fears funding cuts could see services which are particularly vital to disadvantaged children \"dwindling away\".\nIt backs the government's promise to provide 30 hours of free childcare every week to all three- and four-year-olds, but says that without the wider support provided by children's centres, the poorest will still lag behind their wealthier peers.\n\"Cuts to basic early support now will only result in in increased costs in the future \" said chief executive Javed Khan.\n\"Without the vital support of children's centres to the poorest children and families, we are simply neglecting the seeds of more costly problems later in the shape of troubled families, crime, substance abuse and unemployment.\n\"Investing in the UK's children's centres simply makes sense - not only are we investing in our children, we are investing in our future.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said recent research showed record numbers of children were now using the centres.\n\"We want to see a strong network of children's centres in place across the country, offering families access to a wide range of local, flexible services, tackling disadvantage and preparing children for life in modern Britain.\n\"Councils have a duty to ensure sufficient children's centres to meet local need and to ensure they consult before any significant changes are made, including taking into account the views of local families and communities.\n\"Local councils are best placed to decide on provision in their communities. Since 2010, we have increased funding for early intervention to \u00a32.4bn to help them meet local need.\"\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the past five years had seen about a 40% reduction in the overall amount central government provides for children's services.\n\"This has had consequences for children's centres and other services councils provide,\" said David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board.\n\"We welcome the fact that more children and families are using children's centres but at a time when budgets are stretched there are limits to what can be achieved when councils are having to serve more families and children with less money.\"",

        "document": "In Wales, councils are responsible for funding and overseeing schools.\nBut in England, Mr Osborne's plan will mean local authorities will cease to have a role in providing education.\nAcademies are directly funded by central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works.\nIt is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa's Dyke.\nAnd although the Welsh Government will get extra cash to match the money for English schools to extend the school day, it can spend it on any devolved policy area.\nMinisters have no plans to follow suit.\nAt the moment, governing bodies are responsible for setting school hours and they need ministerial permission to make significant changes.\nThere are already more than 2,000 secondary academies in England and its extension to all state schools is unlikely to shake the Welsh Government's attachment to what they call a \"community, comprehensive model\" for schools.\nIt rejects claims that freedom given to academies can help drive up standards, and it points to academy-free Scotland as the best performing school system in the UK.\nEducation Minister Huw Lewis said there was \"very little evidence to suggest\" academies have a positive impact in driving up standards and Wales would not be following the model.\n\"The Tories have wasted hundreds of millions of pounds on academies and free schools and as the Chancellor finalises his budget plans to slash vital services even further, he is committing them to wasting even more on a failing endeavour.\n\"We have no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here in Wales.\"\nNone of the main parties in May's Assembly election - including the Welsh Conservatives - have said they want to introduce academies in Wales.\nOwen Hathway, NUT Cymru's policy officer, called the academy plans for England \"scandalous.\".\n\"There is no evidence that academies work, no evidence that they raise standards, no evidence that they offer better quality education and no evidence that they are what parents and communities want,\" he said.\n\"Certainly a commitment to comprehensive education is something we would want, and indeed expect, all parties to hold firm to in their manifestos for the forthcoming Welsh election.\"\nBut the Welsh and English schools systems are still linked by a joint arrangement for teachers' pay and conditions.\nAcademies are not tied to these pay scales so in effect Wednesday's announcement will take all English schools out of the system and raise questions about the viability of an England and Wales pay and conditions structure.\nThere is already growing momentum for the devolution of teachers' pay and conditions.\nOriginally sceptical, the Welsh Labour Government is now broadly in favour.\nSome teaching unions remain opposed because of concern that Welsh teachers would end up being paid less than those in England.\nMr Hathway said teachers were concerned it could lead to regional pay.\n\"At the same time we do of course recognise that the issue of pay is already becoming a grey area due to the negative changes we see taking place in England,\" he said.\nBut an even bigger difference between the schools landscape on either side of the border, appears to make separate arrangements for pay increasingly likely in future.",

A draw will see Boro promoted and send the Seagulls into the play-offs.\nBBC Sport looks back at five dramatic deciders from years past. Will the Championship season's climax rival any of these classics?\nLiverpool 0-2 Arsenal, 1989\nLiverpool led the First Division table by three points before their final league game of the season against closest rivals Arsenal at Anfield.\nIf they avoided a two-goal home defeat, the Reds would become the first English team to win the double for a second time.\nArsenal, leading 1-0 through Alan Smith, entered stoppage time needing to score once more to be champions.\nCue a moment of iconic commentary from ITV's Brian Moore: \"Smith for Thomas, charging through the midfield...\n\"Thomas, it's up for grabs now... Thomas! Right at the end! An unbelievable climax to the league season!\"\nManchester City 0-1 Luton, 1983\nLong before Paul Dickov's play-off final goal at Wembley in 1999 or Sergio Aguero's Premier League title-winner in 2012, Manchester City found themselves on the wrong end of some late drama.\nCity only needed a draw with Luton at Maine Road to ensure top-flight survival, while the Hatters needed to win to stay up and send City down.\nAs full-time approached, Raddy Antic fired in the from the edge of the penalty area to put the visitors ahead.\n\"Has Luton's life in the harsh world of the English First Division been saved by a Yugoslav?\" asked BBC commentator John Motson.\nYes it had, and who can forget the sight of Luton manager David Pleat racing onto the pitch to celebrate with his players?\nBrentford 0-1 Doncaster, 2013\nHow joy can turn to despair, and vice versa, in 18 seconds. Brentford fans and Marcello Trotta - look away now.\nDoncaster began the final day of the League One season needing a draw at Griffin Park to be promoted. A Brentford win would have taken the Bees up instead.\nWith the score 0-0 in the 94th minute, referee Michael Oliver awarded the home side a penalty. Trotta stepped up and thumped it against the crossbar.\nRovers immediately broke forward and James Coppinger netted the winner for the visitors at the other end.\nThat goal and results elsewhere meant Doncaster were champions. Brentford finished third and lost to Yeovil in the play-off final.\nChelsea 2-1 Liverpool, 2003\nThis is the tale of how Jesper Gronkjaer helped Chelsea win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Europa League and the Champions League.\nThat may sound a little far-fetched, but Chelsea could have been a far different club had the Denmark international winger not scored the winner in the Blues' final game of the 2002-03 Premier League campaign against Liverpool.\nVictory guaranteed Claudio Ranieri's side a place in the following season's Champions League. A few weeks later, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich completed his takeover of Chelsea, who were reported to be \u00a380m in debt at the time.\nAbramovich's investment since then? It is estimated to be more than \u00a31bn.\nHereford 1-1 Brighton, 1997\nForget fighting for a Premier League place - as recently as 1997, Brighton were fighting to stay in the Football League.\nDefeat at bottom club Hereford on the final day of the season would have left Brighton contemplating life in the Conference. \"There's an awful lot at stake,\" said boss Steve Gritt.\nKerry Mayo's own goal put Hereford in front but Robbie Reinelt netted the equaliser that Brighton required to preserve their Football League status.\nIt was an emotional moment for their supporters, who had seen the Seagulls win their final game at the Goldstone Ground - their home for nearly a century - a week earlier.\nGritt, who had taken charge five months earlier with Brighton 11 points adrift at the bottom of the fourth tier, admitted afterwards: \"It's not something I really want to go through again.\"",
