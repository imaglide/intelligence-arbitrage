        "question": "Emma's bank account has $100 in it. Each day of the week, she spends $8. At the end of the week, she goes to the bank and asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?",
        "reasoning": "1. Emma starts with $100 in her bank account.\n2. She spends $8 each day for 7 days (a week).\n3. Total amount spent in a week = 7 days * $8\/day = $56.\n4. Amount remaining after spending = Initial amount - Total spent = $100 - $56 = $44.\n5. Emma asks the bank to give her as many $5 bills as possible from the remaining $44.\n6. Number of $5 bills she can get = Floor($44 \/ $5) = 8 (since 8 * $5 = $40).\n7. Amount given in $5 bills = 8 * $5 = $40.\n8. Remaining amount in her account after getting $5 bills = $44 - $40 = $4.",

        "question": "Don throws 3 darts.  One is a bullseye worth 50 points.  One completely missed the target, so received no points. The third was worth half the points of the bullseye.  What is the final score from these 3 throws?",
        "reasoning": "1. The first dart is a bullseye worth 50 points.\n2. The second dart completely missed, so it scores 0 points.\n3. The third dart is worth half of the bullseye's points. Since the bullseye is worth 50 points, half of that is \\( \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\) points.\n4. To find the final score, add up the points from all three darts: \n   - Bullseye: 50 points\n   - Missed dart: 0 points\n   - Half bullseye: 25 points\n\n5. Total score = 50 + 0 + 25 = 75.",
