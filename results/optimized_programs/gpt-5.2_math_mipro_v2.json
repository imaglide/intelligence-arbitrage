        "reasoning": "Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, and 1 dozen = 12, so Mimi has 2 \u00d7 12 = 24 shells.  \nKyle found twice as many as Mimi: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48 shells.  \nLeigh grabbed one-third of Kyle\u2019s shells: 48 \u00f7 3 = 16 shells.",

        "reasoning": "Let the number of cats be \\(c\\).\nSnakes: \\(c+6\\).\nParrots: \\(c-1\\).\nPets with four legs are cats and dogs. He has 2 dogs and a total of 6 four-legged pets, so:\n\\[\nc + 2 = 6 \\Rightarrow c = 4\n\\]\nThen snakes \\(= 4+6 = 10\\), parrots \\(= 4-1 = 3\\), dogs \\(= 2\\).\nTotal pets:\n\\[\n4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19\n\\]",

Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?",
        "reasoning": "Let the uncle give \\(u\\) cars.  \nAuntie gave 1 more than the uncle: \\(u+1=6 \\Rightarrow u=5\\).  \nGrandpa gave twice the uncle: \\(2u=2\\cdot 5=10\\).  \nDad gave 10 cars, which is 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave \\(10+5=15\\).  \n\nTotal gifts \\(= \\text{Grandpa }10 + \\text{Uncle }5 + \\text{Dad }10 + \\text{Mum }15 + \\text{Auntie }6 = 46\\).  \nStarting with 150 cars, total after gifts \\(=150+46=196\\).",
