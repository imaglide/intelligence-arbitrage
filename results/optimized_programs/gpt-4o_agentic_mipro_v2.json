        "question": "Would a packed Wembley stadium be likely to have a descendant of the Mongols inside?",
        "reasoning": "Wembley Stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 90,000 people. The Mongol Empire, at its height, was the largest contiguous empire in history and covered a vast area of Asia and Europe. Many people today can trace their ancestry back to the Mongols due to the extensive reach and influence of the empire. Given the large number of people in a packed Wembley Stadium and the widespread genetic legacy of the Mongols, it is statistically likely that at least one person in the stadium would have Mongol ancestry.",
