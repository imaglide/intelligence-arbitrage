        "reasoning": "1. Emma starts with $100 in her bank account.\n2. She spends $8 each day for 7 days, which totals to $8 * 7 = $56.\n3. After spending, the remaining balance in her account is $100 - $56 = $44.\n4. She goes to the bank to withdraw as many $5 bills as possible from the $44.\n5. The number of $5 bills she can get is $44 \u00f7 $5 = 8 (since 8 * $5 = $40).\n6. After withdrawing $40, the remaining balance in her account is $44 - $40 = $4.",

        "reasoning": "Don's first dart is a bullseye worth 50 points. The second dart completely missed the target, so it is worth 0 points. The third dart is worth half the points of the bullseye, which is 50 \/ 2 = 25 points. To find the final score, we add the points from all three darts: 50 (bullseye) + 0 (missed) + 25 (half bullseye) = 75 points.",
