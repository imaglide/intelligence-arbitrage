Given a single natural-language question, produce (1) a brief step-by-step reasoning trace that decomposes the question into the necessary factual hops\/constraints (e.g., identify the entity, apply qualifiers like \u201cwho is married to,\u201d handle comparisons\/disambiguation, then combine the results), and (2) a final short answer.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use widely accepted general knowledge; if the question implies a specific relation (spouse, birthplace, author, capital, etc.), retrieve that exact property.\n- Resolve ambiguity by using all constraints in the question (time period, nationality, \u201cthe one that\u2026\u201d, superlatives, comparisons). Prefer the most commonly referenced entity if still ambiguous.\n- For multi-hop questions, explicitly chain the intermediate facts in the reasoning, ensuring each hop supports the next.\n- Keep the final answer minimal: usually a single entity name (or short phrase) with no extra explanation, punctuation, or multiple candidates unless the question explicitly asks for more than one.\n- If the question cannot be confidently answered from common knowledge, state that in the reasoning and give the best-supported guess in the answer (still concise).\n\nOutput format:\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to ...\nAnswer: <short final answer>",
