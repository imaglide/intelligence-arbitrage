        "question": "TreQuan is throwing rocks in the river and he notices that the bigger the rock, the wider the splash. Pebbles make a splash that is a 1\/4 meter wide. Rocks make a splash that is 1\/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?",
        "reasoning": "First, we need to find the width of each type of splash. For pebbles, it's 1\/4 meter wide, for rocks it's 1\/2 a meter wide, and for boulders it's 2 meters wide. TreQuan tosses 6 pebbles, so their total width is 6 * (1\/4) = 1.5 meters. He tosses 3 rocks, so their total width is 3 * (1\/2) = 1.5 meters. He tosses 2 boulders, so their total width is 2 * 2 = 4 meters. Adding all the splash widths together gives us a total of 1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters.",

        "question": "Don throws 3 darts.  One is a bullseye worth 50 points.  One completely missed the target, so received no points. The third was worth half the points of the bullseye.  What is the final score from these 3 throws?",
        "reasoning": "First, we find the points scored by the dart that was worth half the points of the bullseye. Since the bullseye is worth 50 points, half of it would be 50\/2 = 25 points.\n\nThe final score from these 3 throws is the sum of the scores from each throw: 50 (bullseye) + 0 (missed target) + 25 (half bullseye) = 75 points.",
